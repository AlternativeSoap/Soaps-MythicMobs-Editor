## December 2025 - Big Quality Update

### What Changed?

**Cleaned up the database** - We found and removed a bunch of duplicate mechanics, triggers, and targeters that were confusing. No more seeing the same thing twice in the lists!

**Added tons of new stuff** - Added 19 new targeters, 4 new mechanics, and 1 new trigger! More options for building complex skills and mobs.

**Better organization** - Added a new "Meta" category for mechanics that modify other mechanics. Makes it easier to find what you're looking for!

**Fixed broken templates** - Some of the example templates were using mechanics that don't actually exist in MythicMobs. We fixed all of those so the examples actually work now.

**Fixed typos and errors** - Corrected mistakes in mechanic names and updated their settings to match the latest MythicMobs version.

**Made things clearer** - Updated a lot of descriptions to be easier to understand. Less jargon, more helpful explanations.

### The Details (For Curious People)

**What got removed:**
- 9 duplicate entries from the mechanic, trigger, and targeter browsers (no more seeing "spin" twice!)
- 2 duplicate conditions that were showing up in the condition browser

**What got added:**
- 19 new targeters like @TargetBlock, @ForwardWall, @NearestStructure, @HighestBlock, @None, @Region
- 4 new mechanics: WorldEditReplace, OpenCustomMenu, ParticleEquation, PrintParentTree
- 1 new trigger: onDismounted (when a mob gets off a vehicle)
- New "Meta" category with 23 mechanics that were in the wrong categories before

**What got fixed:**
- Fixed typo in "setRaiderCanJoinRaid" (had an extra space before)
- Updated mechanics like EnderDragonResetCrystals and EnderDragonSpawnPortal with new settings
- Fixed templates that were using mechanics that don't exist
- Updated icons for over 100 Minecraft items so they show up correctly

## Earlier This Month - Template System & Fixes

### What's This About?

**You can now save and share templates!** - If you make a really cool mob or skill, you can save it as a template and share it with other people. Or browse templates that others have made!

**Better item icons** - Fixed a ton of Minecraft item icons that were showing up wrong or broken. Spawn eggs, shulker boxes, coral - all fixed!

**Search works better** - The search bars don't have overlapping text anymore. Looks much cleaner!

**Confirmation windows look nicer** - When you delete something, the confirmation popup now matches the site's style instead of being an ugly browser popup.

### How Templates Work

1. Make a mob or skill you're proud of
2. Click "Save as Template"
3. Other people can find it and use it!
4. You can browse templates others have made too

Templates get saved to the cloud, so you can access them from any computer once you log in.

## The Really Cool Stuff (Major Features)

### Community Templates
Share your creations with the world! Save your best mobs and skills as templates, or use templates made by other people. Great for learning or getting inspiration.

### Better Icons & Visuals
All the Minecraft item icons now show up correctly. No more mystery boxes or wrong textures!

### More Complete Database
We added a bunch of mechanics, targeters, and triggers that were missing. The editor now has 256 mechanics, 32 triggers, and 83 targeters - covering almost everything MythicMobs can do!

### Better Organization
Mechanics are now organized better with a new "Meta" category. These are special mechanics that modify how other mechanics work, so it makes sense to group them together.

### Quality of Life
Tons of small improvements that make the editor feel more polished - better search, cleaner confirmations, fixed overlaps, smoother experience overall.

## Important Notes

**Your old stuff is safe** - All these updates don't break anything you've already made. Your mobs, skills, and items will still work exactly the same.

**Templates are optional** - You don't HAVE to use the template system. It's just there if you want to share or learn from others.

**Keep exporting backups** - Still a good idea to export your work regularly! Templates are saved to the cloud, but your main packs are saved in your browser.

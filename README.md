## What is this?

This is a free tool that helps you create custom mobs and skills for Minecraft servers using the MythicMobs plugin. Instead of writing complicated YAML code by hand, you can use simple forms and buttons to build everything visually.

Think of it like a character creator for your Minecraft server - but for mobs!

## What can I do with it?

### 🧟 Create Custom Mobs
Make your own monsters with custom health, damage, and abilities. Want a skeleton that shoots fireballs? A zombie that summons minions? You can do that!

### ⚔️ Design Skills
Build special abilities for your mobs. Make them teleport, shoot projectiles, create explosions, heal themselves - the possibilities are endless.

### 💎 Make Custom Items
Create unique weapons and tools with custom names, descriptions, and enchantments. Perfect for boss drops or quest rewards.

### 📦 Organize Everything
Keep your creations organized in different packs. You can have one pack for boss mobs, another for regular enemies, and another for custom items.

### 📝 Get the Code
When you're done, just copy the generated YAML code and paste it into your MythicMobs folder. It's that simple!

### 🌟 Share with the Community (NEW!)
Create an account and save your best creations as templates! Other users can browse and use your templates, and you can use theirs too. It's like a library of awesome mobs and skills made by the community.

**How it works:**
- Make something cool (a mob or skill)
- Click "Save as Template" 
- Give it a name and description
- Others can find and use it!
- Browse templates made by other people for inspiration

No account needed to use the editor, but you'll need one to save and share templates.

## What makes this tool special?

**No installation needed** - Works right in your browser  
**Saves automatically** - Don't worry about losing your work  
**Visual editing** - Click buttons instead of writing code  
**Live preview** - See the YAML code update as you work  
**Community templates** - Save and share your creations with others  
**Built-in help** - Tooltips and examples guide you along the way  
**Free to use** - Always free, no payments or subscriptions

## How do I use it?

### Getting Started (Super Easy!)

1. **Click the "Try it now!" button** at the top of this page
2. **Create your first pack** - Click the "New Pack" button
3. **Add a mob** - Click "+ New Mob" and fill out the form
4. **See the code** - Watch the YAML appear in the right panel
5. **Copy and paste** - Copy the code and put it in your MythicMobs folder

That's literally it! You don't need to download anything or install anything.

### A Quick Example

Let's say you want to make a fire skeleton boss:

1. Create a new mob, name it "FireSkeleton"
2. Set the health to 200 (normal skeleton has 20)
3. Set the display name to something cool like "Flame Lord"
4. Add some skills like "shootFireball" 
5. Done! The code is ready to copy

## Can I use this on my phone?

The editor works best on computers and tablets. Phones might feel a bit cramped, but it'll work in a pinch!

## Is my work saved?

Yes! Everything saves automatically to your browser. But here's the important part: **if you clear your browser history or cache, your packs will be deleted**. So make sure to export your work regularly as a backup!

**What about templates?** If you create an account, any templates you save are stored in the cloud, so you can access them from any computer!

## Do I need an account?

Nope! You can use the entire editor without an account. The only thing you need an account for is:
- Saving templates to share with others
- Accessing your saved templates from different computers
- Browsing the community template library

Everything else works without logging in!

## Do I need to know how to code?

Nope! That's the whole point of this tool. You just fill out forms, click buttons, and the code writes itself. If you DO know YAML code, you can edit it directly too.

## What is YAML anyway?

YAML is just a way to organize information that the MythicMobs plugin can understand. Think of it like a recipe - you're telling the plugin what ingredients (settings) to use for your mob. This tool writes the recipe for you!

## Tips and Tricks

**Make colorful names** - Use `&` codes for colors! For example: `&4Fire &6Golem` makes red "Fire" and gold "Golem"
- Colors: `&0` through `&9` and `&a` through `&f`
- Bold: `&l` • Italic: `&o` • Underline: `&n`

**Save your work often** - Click the export button to download backups of your packs

**Start simple** - Don't try to make a super complicated boss right away. Start with a basic mob and add things one at a time

**Test in-game** - Always test your mobs on a test server first before using them on your main server

**Use the examples** - The tool has built-in examples you can learn from

## Example: What You Can Make

Here's a simple fire skeleton boss you could create:

**FireKing Skeleton**
- 200 health (10x normal!)
- Shoots fireballs every 5 seconds
- Summons 3 helper skeletons when below 50% health
- Drops a special flaming sword

All of that would take about 2 minutes to set up in this tool. Without the tool, you'd be writing 30+ lines of code by hand!

- Clear your browser data
- Use a different browser

Your packs won't be there! Always export backups to be safe.
